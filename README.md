The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
It is now ready to be deployed.

1. Adding a home screen
2. Using Three.js or another 3D rendering library to create a 3D Pokedex interface
